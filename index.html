									<h3>799 American Nursing Homes Received Abuse Alerts in 2019</h2>
									<p>	A nursing home is a place for the elderly who can’t be cared for at home and need 24-hour nursing care. However, too many cases of elder abuse in nursing homes have consistently got reported and remained unaddressed in the U.S. It is time for all of us to take a close look and take action!<br /><br />
									This "Nursing Homes with Abuse Alerts App", independently developed on my own by R shiny, contains detailed information of 11,994 Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing home nationwide and lays emphasis on 799 nursing homes which have been flagged with abuse alerts.</p>

											<h3>Dog Raising Preference</h3>
											<p>Being a single parent is not an easy job. Single fathers and mothers need to manage stuff on your own, taking care of the kid is one thing but fulfilling their needs on time and managing your career and house simultaneously is very tough. In these situations, raising dogs will be very helpful since dogs will help accompany kids and reduce individual stress. 
												Check the project to see if there is relation between single parent households and dog raising in the neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. </p>

															<h3>Bikeshare system rebalancing within the DC Metro area</h3>
															<p>Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) was one of the first big public bikeshare systems in the United State offering bike rental service within the DC Metro area. The program offers bikes for rental (by single-ride or membership) at nearly 700 stations in DC and Arlington, VA (and more in more distant cities). One of the biggest objectives of bikesharing systems is to make it possible that people can bike without owning their own bicycle at the expense of a small subscription fee.</p>

																<h3>Hedonic Home Price Prediction in Miami, FL</h3>
																<p>Miami is a global tourist destination, well known for the local beaches, such as Miami Beach and South Beach, which best represent the uniqueness of Miami. The tourism and real estate industry have been dominating Miami’s economy and mutually boosting each other. There are other aspects that make the real estate market unique and make sales price prediction in Miami trickier than in other cities.</p>

																		<h3>BeRail, Be Easy</h3>
																		<p>With the increasing demand of taking trains as well as the unbalanced development across the Belgium, some train lines can be extremely busy with a high occupancy level, while other lines might be under operated. City planners and train conductors are super interested in the tool which can help them analyze and estimate the train occupancy level, so that they can develop a better understanding of optimizing railway operation across the country. </p>

																		<h3>Student Engagement Predictions and Course Achievement</h3>
																		<p>Due to the absence of face-to-face meetings, online learning systems face the challenge to timely track student progress. Accordingly, efforts are systematically made to design predictive models that can predict students at risk of dropping or failing an online module so that instructors can provide timely and appropriate interventions that will support students and scaffold successful module or degree.  </p>
